## Problem Statement and Background

– Give a clear and complete statement of the problem. Don’t describe methods or tools yet. 

Where does the data come from, what are its characteristics? 
  
– Include background material as appropriate: 

∗ who cares about this problem
∗ what impact it has
∗ what implications better solutions might have. 

– Include a brief summary of any related work you know about.



## Methods

Methods
– Describe the methods your team explored. Justify your team’s methods in terms
of the problem statement. What methods did you consider but not use?
– Include every method you tried, even if it did not “work”. When describing
methods that didn’t work, make clear how they failed and any evaluation metrics
you used to decide so.


## Tools

Describe the tools that your team used and why. Justify the tools used in terms
of the problem itself and the methods your team was aiming to utilize.
∗ Tools can include anything from packages used for data wrangling and visualization to machine learning and statistical processing.
– How did you employ the tools used? What features worked well and what did not?
– Describe any tools that you tried and ended up not using. What was the problem?
Briefly, what could be improved in these packages to make them more functional?

## Results

– Give a detailed summary of the results of your work. Here is where you specify the
exact performance measures you used. Usually there will be some kind of accuracy
or quality measure. There may also be a performance (runtime or throughput)
measure.

– Please use visualizations and tables whenever possible. Include links to interactive
visualizations or websites if you built them.



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
