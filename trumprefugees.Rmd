## Problem Statement and Background

What does the most recent available data tell us about refugee integration outcomes in the United States?

- Annual Survey of Refugees 2016 (ASR)
- National Policy Debate

1. Who exactly are the refugees and where are they?
2. What do we know about the education and employment outcomes of refugees?
3. Do refugees represent a burden on the tax system?

## Methods

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Shiny dashboard
- Data cleaning and wrangling

## Tools
- Git and Github
- ggplot and ggplot2 
- shiny and shinythemes 
- shinydashboard 
- Shinyapps


## Results 

We have compiled the results of our EDA analysis into a dashboard deployed via ShinyApps. Our target audience is the general public interested in discovering the evidence behind refugee outcomes.
