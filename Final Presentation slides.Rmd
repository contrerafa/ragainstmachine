## Research question and background

<h1 align="center" style="color:#B22222;">What does the most recent available data tell us about refugee integration outcomes in the United States?</h1>
<br>

1. Who exactly are the refugees and where are they?
2. What do we know about the education and employment outcomes of refugees?
3. Do refugees represent a burden on the tax system?

## Data

<p align="center" style="color:#4682B4; font-size: 38px;">Annual Survey of Refugees 2016</p>

- Most recent, nationally representative survey of refugees resettled in the US in 2011-2015. 
- Source: Office of Refugee Resettlement at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
- First 5 years in the US. Progress towards learning English, participating in the workforce, and establishing permanent residence. 
- Dataset: 1,500 households and more than 4,000 individuals.
- Availabilty: STATA database to researchers from accredited universities.

## Methods

- Bringing data into R (a challenge in itself?)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): open-minded exploration!
- Data visualization
- Shiny Dashboard: putting our designer's hat on.

## Tools
- ggplot and ggplot2 
- shiny and shinythemes 
- shinydashboard 
- Shinyapps
- Git and Github

## Results 
We have compiled the results of our EDA analysis into a dashboard deployed and accessible via ShinyApps. The target audience of the dashboard is the general public interested in discovering the evidence behind refugee outcomes.
